# Part-3: Strings

**1. Are all Stringâ€™s immutable?**
> *Answer:* Yes, In java all strings are immutable (expected StringBuilder and StringBuffer). This means that once a string is created, its contents cannot be modified. Any operation that appears to modify a string actually creates a new string with the modified content, leaving the original string unchanged.
