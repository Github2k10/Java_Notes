# Part-7: Collections

**1. Why do we need Collections in Java?**
> *Answer:* Collections are an essential part of Java programming as they provide a way to store and manipulate groups of objects efficiently. They offer a flexible, reusable, and easy-to-use solution for storing and managing data in a program. <br>
> Collection provide efficient storage and retrieval, dynamic data structures, polymorphism, and standardized interfaces that's make collections important part of Java programming.

**2. What are the important interfaces in the Collection Hierarchy?**
> *Answer:* The most important interface in the collection hierarchy are: <br>
> 1. Collection Interface: This is the root interface of the java collection framework. It defines the basic methods that all Collections should have, such as add(), remove(), and size(), etc. <br>
> 2. List Interface: The List interface extends the Collection inter face and provides an ordered collection of elements that can contain duplicates. It allows elements to be added or removed at any position in the list. <br>
> 3. Set Interface. The Set interface extends the Collection interface and provides an unordered collection of elements that cannot contain duplicates. <br>
> 4. Queue Interface: The Queue interface extends the Collection interface and provides a collection of elements that supports operations like enqueues and dequeue. It is typically used to implement data structures like queues and stacks. <br>
> 5. Map Interface: The Map interface represents a mapping between a set of keys and a set of values. It does not extend the Collection interface. <br>
> 6. Iterator Interface: The Iterator Interface is used to iterate over elements in a collection. It provides methods like hasNext() and next() to traverse elements in the collection.
