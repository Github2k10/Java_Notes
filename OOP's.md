# Part-4: OOP's

**1. What is a Class?**
> *Answer:* In java, a class is a blueprint or template that defines the characteristics and behavior of an object. It is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming and is used to create objects, which is instance of class. <br>
> A class consist of data field(variables) and methods(functions) that define the properties and behavior of the objects created from the class. The data fields represent the object's state or properties, and the methods represent the object's behavior or actions. <br>
> Syntax:
> class class_Name{ //Variables and methods }
> 
<br> 
<br>

**2. What is state of object?**
> *Answer:* The state of an object in Java refers to the current values of its attributes or properties (represented by instance variables), which can change over time as the object's methods are invoked and its state is modified. <br>

<br> <br>

**3. What is behavior of an Object?**
> *Answer:* The behavior of an object in java refers to the actions or operations that the object can perform. These actions or operations are defined by the methods of the object class, and can be invoked by methods on the object. <br>
> In simpler terms, the behavior of an object refers to what the object can do or how it can interact with objects or the system as a whole.

<br> <br>

**4. What is the super class of every class in Java?**
> *Answer:* Object class is super class of every class.
