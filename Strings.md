# Part-3: Strings

**1. Are all Stringâ€™s immutable?**
> *Answer:* Yes, In java all strings are immutable (expected StringBuilder and StringBuffer). This means that once a string is created, its contents cannot be modified. Any operation that appears to modify a string actually creates a new string with the modified content, leaving the original string unchanged.

<br> <br>

**2. Where are string values stored in memory?**
> *Answer:* In java, string values are stored in a special memory area called string pool or string constant pool. <br>
> When a string is created using a string literal, such as "Java", java first checks if the string is already present in the string pool. If the string is not present, java creates a new string a new string object and adds it to the pool. If the string is already present in the pool, java simply returns a reference to the existing string object in the pool.

<br> <br>
**3. Why should you be careful about String Concatenation(+) operator in Loops?**
> *Answer:* In java, '+' operator is used to create a new string object by concatenating the strings. When we are using concatenation in a loop, it will create a new string each time that lead to a significant number of string objects being created, which can have a negative impact on performance and memory usage.

<br> <br>
**4. How do you solve above problem?**
> *Answer:* To avoid this problem, it is recommended to use 'StringBuilder' or 'StringBuffer' instead of the '+' operator for string concatenation in loops. These classes provide more efficient ways to build strings, by creating a single mutable buffer for the string and appending to it in each iteration of the loop.

**5. What are differences between String and StringBuffer?**
> *Answer:* <br>
> | String | StringBuffer |
> | ------ | ------------ |
> | The string class is immutable. | The StringBuffer class is mutable. |
> | It is slow and consumes more memory when we concatenate strings. | It is fast and consumes less memory when we concatenate strings. |
> | String class overrides the equals method of Object class to perform comparison. | StringBuffer class doesn't override the equal method for comparing two strings. |
> | String class uses string constant pool. | StringBuffer uses heap memory. |

<br> <br>
**6. What are differences between StringBuilder and StringBuffer?**
> *Answer:* <br>
> | StringBuilder | StringBuffer |
> | ------------- | ------------ |
> | StringBuilder is non-synchronized. | StringBuffer is synchronized. |
> | StringBuilder is not thread safe. | StringBuffer is thread safe, means two threads can't call the methods of StringBuffer simultaneously. |
> | StringBuilder is more efficient than StringBuffer. | StringBuffer is less efficient than StringBuilder. |
> | StringBuilder was introduced in java 1.5. | StringBuffer was introduced in java 1.0. |

<br> <br>
**7. Can you give examples of different utility methods in String class?** 
> *Answer:* Here are some examples of different utility methods in String class: <br>
> 1. length(): returns the length of string in characters. <br>
>             - String str = "Java"; <br>
>             - int length = str.length(); // length is 4 <br> <br>
> 
> 2. charAt(int index): returns the character at the specified index in the string. <br>
>                      - String str = "Java"; <br>
>                      - char ch = str.charAt(0); // ch is 'J' <br> <br>
> 
> 3. substring(int start, int end): returns a substring starting at the specified begin index and ending at the specified end index (exclusive). <br>
>                                  - String str = "Java";
>                                  - String sub = str.substring(1, 3); // sub is av <br> <br>
> 
> 4. toUpperCase(): returns a new string that is the original string converted to uppercase. <br>
>                  - String str = "Java"; <br>
>                  - String upper = str.toUpperCase() // upper is JAVA <br> <br>
>
> 5. toLowerCase(): returns a new string that is the original string converted to lowercase. <br>
>                  - String str = "JAVA"; <br>
>                  - String lower = str.toLowerCase(); // lower is java <br> <br>
> 
> There are many other utility methods of string class like; trim(), replace(char oldCh, char newCh), startsWith(String prefix), endsWith(String suffix).
