# Part-5: Advanced OOP's

**1. What is Polymorphism?**
> *Answer:* Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they were of the same class. It is the ability of objects to take on different forms or behaviors depending on the context in which they are used. It is a powerful concept that allows for code readability and flexibility in OOP. <br>
> Example: if we have a superclass 'Animal' and two subclasses 'Dog' and 'Cat', then we can treat objects of both classes as 'Animal' object.
